    Web development has always intrigued me. Especially as an artist and graphic designer. To be able to bind visual creativity and programming is fascinating. That’s when I decided to learn it for the first time 5 years ago. I used Codecademy at the time since it was very user friendly, although I stopped soon after starting. Just learning the basics alone showed me how much effort it took to make a fully functional website that looked good. I learnt the basics, such as adding images and text to a page. Since I started off with HTML (obviously), I found it very daunting that I had to learn CSS and Javascript after. So I decided to let it go and focus on other things. Now that I am in University, I decided to continue with web development as became more interested and eager to learn to make good looking websites. 
    The coding aspect of web development is actually fun for me. Whenever I have in issue there was always so many ways of solving it. For example, laying out grids on a website can be done though flex display or grid display. Each having its own pros and cons. It can definitely	become tedious, making multiples files and switching between html and css. However, I always had a feeling of accomplishment whenever I found out how to solve a daunting issue that bugged me (no pun intended) for a while. The things that I end up debugging were easily solvable or none existent once I kept practicing since I know exactly what to do. 
    One aspect of web development that is my favourite out of all of them is the design. As I mentioned, Im an artist so being able to implement colour theory and shapes was like home to me. Designing really helped me to add creativity to the websites I make and make it look less boring and more unique. Yet again, programming can get in the way since I have to organise the layouts and finding answers on YouTube was a bit of an issue since I didn’t want to copy and paste ideas but learn for myself. Also, finding a good website the actually tells you what to do can be hard sometimes since you won’t get a specific answer to that specific problem. Other than that, Its really a piece of cake and its fun. I tend to make websites for friends since its not a chore for me but more of a hobby.
    In terms of my university module, I have had issues keeping up in class since Ive had so many personal issues to deal with. Overall I like the lectures, might not be anything special but the teacher is one of the most helpful lecturers and not boring in the slightest so that’s a bonus. The slides are pretty straight forward and the assignments are very useful. I mostly found it useful as it kinda solved some of the issues I had in my personal projects as well as the assignment given.
    To be fair, I do assignments in small increments and closer to the deadline as I don’t mind working under pressure so as of writing there are some things missing but not too much. I had an issue with using grid display for my layouts as I tend to use things like flex for my grids as I’ve practiced with them. The UI is very user friendly as Ive used colours that are easy on the eyes instead of the standard black and white. I decided to learn a bit more about grid display since its actually a lot better than the other methods in terms of keeping a consistent layout of the page. The navigation bar is evenly laid out and a hamburger menu will be present soon once I have sorted out the relativeness of the website. I chose a big but modern font for the navigation bar and a similar font for the paragraph and headers for consistency.
